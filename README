NAME
    CPAN::Test::Others - Include tests for other modules on CPAN

SYNOPSIS
    You don't have any use for this module, just run its tests and report
    them to CPAN Testers

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes I have an urge to write tests for other modules. Getting these
    tests included in the real distributin is not always easy, other module
    authors are busy too. They might have a real life.

    So this module does not have its own code, it only has prerequisites and
    tests for those other modules.

TODO
    Add a way to (optionally) send the report to author of the module under
    test.

    Split the module to the part that is needed for such tests and the part
    where my tests are, so others will be able to use it as well.
